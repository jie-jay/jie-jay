### Hi
My name is Jie(Jay), currently pursuing a PhD at the [CLOUDS](http://www.cloudbus.org) lab at the University of Melbourne.  
My research interest includes machine learning, primarily (multi-agent) deep reinforcement learning for cloud resource management and optimisation.  

I have being programming since the late 1990s, started with x86 assembly and C. 
I used two dozens of programming languages in my industry career(primarily Java/C#/Go), and currenly obsessed with Julia.
