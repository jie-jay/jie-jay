### Hi
My name is Jie(Jay), currently pursuing a PhD at the [CLOUDS](http://www.cloudbus.org) lab at the University of Melbourne.  
My research interest includes machine learning, primarily (multi-agent) deep reinforcement learning for cloud resource management and optimisation.  

Before start my PhD, I worked for 12 years. The latest role was in a retail company as a software engineer -> IT Infrastructure Manager -> CTO. I'm also a AWS certified solution architect.

I have being programming since the late 1990s, started with x86 assembly and C.  
I used two dozens of programming languages in my career(primarily Java/C#/Go), and currenly obsessed with Julia.   

My favourite OS is FreeBSD.
I'm a hater of scripting language and ORM, they bite me too many times in the past.

I can be reached through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jie-zhao-64843765).
